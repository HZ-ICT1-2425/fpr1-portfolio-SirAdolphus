            Why did I choose IT?
        </h1>
        <p class="niceWhite">
            I chose IT for multiple reasons.
            First of I love the computer as a machine I think it's so intreguing!
            The develepment of the computer went so fast and branched out into so many things!
            Like game computers and later the merge with mobile phones. <br> <br>

            But thats just hardware! my love for the software side came from (just like a lot of other people) video
            games!
            The things they make in videogames are so impressive to me and they keep improving!
            I know a lot of it visual design but a lot of it is code aswell! <br> <br>

        <h1 class="niceYellow">What do I hope for my future?</h1>
        <p class="niceWhite">
            Ofcourse like most people I wish for a bright future for myself!
            I hope to one day work a fully remote IT job!
            The freedom it gives make for me life awesome and is the absolute dream!
            I love the flexibility of working remote whether at home in the garden, a home office or out of the country to
            travel!
            You'll be able to do the work you love!

            The work I love?
            How do I know this is the work I love?!
            To be completely honest I don't...
            However I do love solving puzzles and creating stuff!
            But that you can read in my motivation blog! ;) <br> <br>
