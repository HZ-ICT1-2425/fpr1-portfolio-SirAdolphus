                <h2>Why did I choose IT?</h2> <br>
                I chose IT for multiple reasons.
                First of I love the computer as a machine I think it's so intreguing!
                The develepment of the computer went so fast and branched out into so many things!
                Like game computers and later the merge with mobile phones. <br> <br>

                But thats just hardware! my love for the software side came from (just like a lot of other people) video
                games!
                The things they make in videogames are so impressive to me and they keep improving!
                I know a lot of it visual design but a lot of it is code aswell! <br> <br>

                <h2>What do I hope for my future?</h2> <br>
                Ofcourse like most people I wish for a bright future for myself!
                I hope to one day work a fully remote IT job!
                The freedom it gives make for me life awesome and is the absolute dream!
                I love the flexibility of working remote whether at home in the garden, a home office or out of the country to
                travel!
                You'll be able to do the work you love! <br> <br>

                The work I love?
                How do I know this is the work I love?!
                To be completely honest I don't....
                However I do love solving puzzles and creating stuff!
                But that you can read in my motivation blog! ;) <br> <br>
